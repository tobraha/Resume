# Resume - Thomas B. Harris

This repository contains the source files for my Resume. The workflow compiles
and publishes the document to my website:

## Resume Source

This Resume format was forked from Carmine Spagnuolo's "Twenty Seconds Resume"
(original repository [here](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex))
and thus inherits its MIT License.

I learned a great deal about LaTeX in creating my Resume from Carmine's template.
